	abstract = {“Zoom fatigue”—theorized here as part of a larger experience with computer-mediated communication ({CMC}) exhaustion—has emerged as a common negative experience through prolonged use of {CMC} platforms. Despite {CMC} exhaustion’s ubiquity, the relatively novel phenomenon has caused much speculation for its root causes with little information pinpointing why it occurs. Utilizing research, observations, and personal accounts, this article explores synchronous online consultations ({SOCs}) within writing centers as matching sites to ponder the basis for {CMC} exhaustion. In doing so, third skins are proposed to account for how nuanced differences in space between {SOCs} and face-to-face exchanges mean participants are not engaged as human actors but “flattened” into a totality of third skin comprising person, background, and technology. The resulting transformation and our bodies exerting substantial cognitive efforts to interact with this transformation are theorized to produce {CMC} exhaustion. The implications for this are twofold: 1) for readers interested in the underlying causes of {CMC} exhaustion, this work presents a framework to test the ideas proposed and develop mitigating strategies, and 2) for readers who study {SOCs}, third skins might explain previously observed limitations in the effectiveness of visuality in {CMC}.},

One reason why media usage may be associated with self-objectification is because women may be comparing their appearance to others in the media. The present study examined (a) the relationship between the usage of different media types (online social media [Facebook], Internet, television, music videos, and magazines) and self-objectification among young women, (b) whether appearance comparison tendencies in general mediated any observed relationships, and (c) whether appearance comparisons to specific types of women on Facebook (self, family, close friends, distant peers, and celebrities) mediated any relationship between Facebook usage and self-objectification. Female participants (N = 150) aged 17–25 years completed questionnaires about their media usage, appearance comparison tendency in general, appearance comparisons to specific target groups on Facebook, and self-objectification. Results showed that Facebook usage and magazine usage were positively correlated with self-objectification and that these relationships were mediated by appearance comparisons in general. In addition, the relationship between Facebook usage and self-objectification was mediated by comparisons to one’s peers on Facebook.

This study examines the effects of daily {IG} use on state self-objectification and well-being among Western college-aged women. Participants completed an initial assessment (N = 45) followed by daily-diary responses (N = 481) for up to 13 nights, reporting each day’s {IG} use, self-objectifying thoughts and feelings on that day, daily well-being, and daily mood. Results from multilevel models indicated that, as hypothesized, using more {IG} on a particular day was related to increased self-reported state self-objectification on that same day. Daily {IG} use was also related to lower daily life satisfaction and higher daily negative mood. Further, results provide evidence that state self-objectifying feelings partially explain the relationship between {IG} use and negative mood (but not life satisfaction). The results of this study suggest that daily exposure to visual social media posts on {IG} may have adverse effects. Future studies exploring these effects in samples with greater variation in terms of gender and ethnicity are needed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

However, the repercussions of this change are not fully known, and issues regarding appearance satisfaction are particularly salient. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between video chatting and appearance satisfaction in a sample of men and women. Method The current study utilizes cross-sectional data from 618 participants (Age: M = 33.2; 54.1\% women) to evaluate whether average video chat usage predicts appearance satisfaction, and whether this association is dependent upon appearance comparison or self-objectification. Results Results indicated that individuals who spent more time video chatting reported higher appearance satisfaction. Additionally, appearance comparison and self-objectification were not significant moderators, and the association between video chat usage and appearance satisfaction did not differ based on gender. Usage of the touch-up feature, gallery view, and amount of time spent looking at oneself were associated with appearance comparisons, while adjusting lighting and camera angles and amount of time spent looking at oneself were associated with self-objectification. Discussion The results may indicate that while overall time spent video chatting may be associated with lower appearance concerns, examination of the usage of specific features on video chatting platforms may be important to assess in the future.

The first revealed a pattern of differences between means that was consistent with the hypothesis, although the expected interaction of word content and presence of mirror and camera to produce longer color-naming latencies did not appear. Also, self-relevant words were read faster than neutral words, even though they had been matched for length, frequency, and part of speech. In the second study (a refinement of the first), the expected interaction was significant.

	shorttitle = {Self-objectification and depression},
	abstract = {Background
Objectification Theory positions self-objectification as a cause of depression. In particular, the authors offer Objectification Theory as a partial explanation for the higher prevalence of depression among women than men. To investigate the validity of this theory, we undertook a systematic review of quantitative studies that have investigated self-objectification as a predictor of depression.
Methods
Studies were identified by searching the {PsycINFO}, Medline, {EMBASE} and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms were ‘objectif⁎’ {OR} ‘body conscious⁎’ {AND} ‘depressi⁎’ {OR} ‘dysthymi⁎’ {OR} ‘mood disorder’. To be eligible, studies were required to be in the English-language, to include a measure of depression and a measure of self-objectification. Studies were excluded if they did not explicitly examine the association between these variables.
Results
Among women most studies found a mediated effect for self-objectification on depression. All studies including adolescents found a direct effect. Each of the two prospective longitudinal studies found that an increase in self-objectification over time was associated with a concomitant increase in depression, suggesting a causal relationship. Among men the results were mixed.
Limitations
The review did not include a quantitative synthesis due to the heterogeneity of the included observational studies. The majority of the studies were cross-sectional precluding conclusions concerning causality.

Conclusions
Self-objectification may be a useful predictor of depression, particularly among women and adolescents, and may have clinical relevance among these populations.},

This article contains errors in the Participants sections. The corrected information is included in the erratum.] Objectification theory (B. L. Fredrickson \& T Roberts, 1997) posits that American culture socializes women to adopt observers' perspectives on their physical selves. This self-objectification is hypothesized to (a) produce body shame, which in turn leads to restrained eating, and (b) consume attentional resources, which is manifested in diminished mental performance. Two experiments manipulated self-objectification by having participants try on a swimsuit or a sweater. Experiment 1 tested 72 women and found that self-objectification increased body shame, which in turn predicted restrained eating. Experiment 2 tested 42 women and 40 men and found that these effects on body shame and restrained eating replicated for women only. Additionally, self-objectification diminished math performance for women only. Discussion centers on the causes and consequences of objectifying women's bodies.

Participants who experienced more objectification (Studies 1a and 1b), imagined being objectified (Study 2), or recalled a past objectification experience (Study 3) felt less authentic and reported lower levels of subjective well-being than their counterparts. Moreover, perceived authenticity mediated the link between objectification and subjective well-being (Studies 1a–3). In addition, offering objectified participants an opportunity to restore authenticity could enhance their well-being (Study 4). Taken together, our findings highlight the crucial role of authenticity in understanding when and why objectification decreases subjective well-being and how to ameliorate this relationship.

The purpose of the present study was to extend past research by examining the effects of self-objectification in the context of social relationships among young adults. Participants were 235 undergraduates (55.7\% females). A three-step model was successfully tested: results showed that internalization of media standards is related to increased self-objectification (β = .33, {SE} = .08, p = .01), which in turn is associated with authenticity, being high self-objectifiers less devoted to authentic living (β = –.21, {SE} = .09, p = .01) and more self-alienated (β = .14, {SE} = .08, p = .04) and dependent on others’ influence (β = .50, {SE} = .01, p = .01). The pattern of these relationships did not significantly vary across gender (χ2 = 6.29; p = .18).

To understand the psychological consequences of this recent global lifestyle change in different populations, the psychometric validation of the Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue Scale ({ZEFS}) and the relationship of this construct with academic well-being, mental well-being, and life satisfaction are presented. In a sample of 470 Turkish university students (57 percent female, Mage = 20.26 – 2.18, ranging between 18 and 33 years), ﬁrst-order and second-order conﬁrmatory factor analyses conﬁrmed the construct validity of the scale, and the item response theory results yielded appropriate item difﬁculty and discrimination. {ZEFS} scores were signiﬁcantly and positively associated with anxiety, depression, and stress, and negatively associated with life satisfaction and academic well-being, supporting the scale’s concurrent validity. Incremental validity was shown with mediational models demonstrating signiﬁcant and separate indirect effects of Zoom exhaustion and fatigue on life satisfaction and academic well-being, both mediated by psychological distress. The results suggest {ZEFS} to be a valid and reliable tool to evaluate the psychological consequences of videoconferencing, which has globally increased during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, in non-Western samples. By showing the relationships of Zoom exhaustion and fatigue with psychological distress, life satisfaction, and academic well-being, the present study highlights potential avenues to be addressed to protect the mental well-being of all individuals who have integrated videoconferencing as part of their daily lives.},

Given implications for employee well-being, this study investigated Zoom fatigue at work and its potential link to mental health symptoms. A national survey of mental health symptoms was conducted in the United States during the {COVID}-19 pandemic in August 2020. Adults (n = 902) endorsing a shift at work to videoconferencing completed an online survey; survey criteria included an age minimum of 22 years and reported annual gross income of {\textless}\$75,000. Statistical raking was employed to weight the sample using U.S. census data on geographic region, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. A three-item Zoom Fatigue Scale measuring perceived stress, isolation, and depression associated with videoconferencing at work showed good internal consistency (α = 0.85). Higher scores on this scale were related to being married, nonwhite race, post-high school education, severe mental illness, greater loneliness, lower social support, lacking money for food, and more weekly videoconference calls. Depressive symptoms demonstrated a significant association with Zoom fatigue, even when adjusting for demographic, psychosocial, and clinical covariates. The study findings indicated that employers and employees should consider a complex array of individual-level and environment-level factors when assessing how videoconferencing at work may engender stress, social isolation, and emotional exhaustion. This impact could adversely impact mental health, work productivity, and quality of life, even after the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

Findings Intensity of social media use was the strongest predictor of social media fatigue. Online social comparison and self-disclosure were also significant predictors of social media fatigue. The findings also suggest that social media fatigue further contributes to a decrease in academic performance. Originality/value This study builds upon the limited yet growing body of literature on a theme highly relevant for scholars, practitioners as well as social media users. The current study focuses on examining different causes of social media fatigue induced through the use of a highly popular mobile instant messaging app, {WhatsApp}.

Only recently have scholars undertaken empirical studies to investigate its antecedents and outcomes to better understand the impact of fatigue on social media users. To further this understanding, the present study has conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1552 users. The Stress-Strain-Outcome ({SSO}) theoretical framework is applied to examine if privacy concerns, self-disclosure, parental mediation strategies, and decrement in academic performance due to social media use correlate with social media fatigue. Two forms of fatigue are considered, namely, fatigue due to social networking site ({SNS}) and mobile instant messaging ({MIM}) use. The study results suggest that privacy concerns, self-disclosure, parental encouragement and worry significantly and positively correlate with {SNS} and {MIM} fatigue. Parental permission and parental monitoring are either not or lowly associated with fatigue. In addition to this, {SNS} and {MIM} fatigue positively correlated with the tendency to experience academic decrement due to social media use. The antecedents and consequences of social media fatigue were similar for {SNS} and {MIM} users. Moreover, students perceived their parents to be more open to their {MIM} use, and they had higher self-disclosure in {MIM} than in {SNS}.

In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a drastic increase in the number of videoconference meetings, and Zoom became the leading software package because it was free, robust, and easy to use. While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term “Zoom Fatigue” caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.},

The first revealed a pattern of differences between means that was consistent with the hypothesis, although the expected interaction of word content and presence of mirror and camera to produce longer color-naming latencies did not appear. Also, self-relevant words were read faster than neutral words, even though they had been matched for length, frequency, and part of speech. In the second study (a refinement of the first), the expected interaction was significant. The results support one of the central claims of self-awareness theory and suggest an alternative interpretation of classic findings concerning anxiety and memory.},

Second, we show that women have greater Zoom fatigue than men. Third, we show that the five nonverbal mechanisms for fatigue predict Zoom fatigue.

The results demonstrated the persistence of traditional gender prescriptions in both contexts, but also revealed distinct areas of societal vigilance and leeway for each gender.

Participants were 1,104 undergraduate women and men who completed surveys assessing their Facebook usage (minutes, passive use, and active use), social comparison, self-objectification, and well-being. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling, testing separate models for women and men. Models for each gender fit the data well. For women and men, Facebook use was associated with greater social comparison and greater self-objectification, which, in turn, was each related to lower self-esteem, poorer mental health, and greater body shame. Mediated models provided better fits to the data than models testing direct pathways to the mediators and well-being variables.

Given mixed findings in the literature regarding men’s experiences of self-objectification, there is reason to believe that these discrepancies may be a result of the way in which self-objectification is currently being measured. Therefore, we sought to develop and validate an instrument to assess self-objectification specifically in men called the Male Assessment of Self-Objectification ({MASO}). To do so, three studies were conducted, comprising the initial scale development, validation, and test−retest phases of scale construction. Exploratory factor analysis was used in the first study where results yielded two factors. In the second study, results from confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the two-factor model of the {MASO} was superior to a one-factor model. Further, the {MASO} was significantly correlated to the drive for muscularity, body surveillance, and body shame as predicted. Lastly, the results of the final study supported the stability of the {MASO} over a 2-week period. Collectively, results indicate that the {MASO} demonstrates adequate validity and reliability in assessing self-objectification in men.

	abstract = {This article offers objectification theory as a framework for understanding the experiential consequences of being female in a culture that sexually objectifies the female body. Objectification theory posits that girls and women are typically acculturated to internalize an observer's perspective as a primary view of their physical selves. This perspective on self can lead to habitual body monitoring, which, in turn, can increase women's opportunities for shame and anxiety, reduce opportunities for peak motivational states, and diminish awareness of internal bodily states. Accumulations of such experiences may help account for an array of mental health risks that disproportionately affect women: unipolar depression, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders. Objectification theory also illuminates why changes in these mental health risks appear to occur in step with life-course changes in the female body.},

	abstract = {The popularity of videoconferencing platforms has skyrocketed during the {COVID}-19 pandemic; however, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential for video calls to promote appearance dissatisfaction because individuals are exposed to an image of themselves on camera for extended periods.The aim of the current study was to characterize current video usage behaviors and their relation to appearance dissatisfaction and interest in aesthetic procedures in the general population.An online survey was completed by 335 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in video-manipulation techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention (ie, on self or others) while on video calls. The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video-use behaviors were associated with greater body image disturbance.Over one-third of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, greater engagement in video-manipulation behaviors, and increasing appearance concerns due to their time on video calls. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty treatments (eg, waxing) and aesthetic procedures (eg, nonsurgical procedures such as antiwrinkle injections).This is one of first empirical studies to report the potential consequences of video-call usage for increasing appearance dissatisfaction and dysmorphic concern, and to demonstrate a link between the use of video calls and interest in cosmetic procedures.},

The research question concerns the difference between face-to-face-, chat-, and {CVE}- meetings with regard to efficiency, communication process, problems with the technology, enjoyment and competence development. A small group of experts were observed during their natural work meetings. Six of the groups scheduled meetings were held three times in a chat environment and three times in a {CVE}. Results suggests that chat and {CVE} meetings are experienced as more task oriented than face-to-face meetings, and that avatars support turn taking and are enjoyable.},
